The point is that this component expose the follow props:

* suggests (Array): **Required** Array of SuggestObjects. Will be the suggests to show. If you want show nothing send a empty array.
* handleChange (Function): **Required** Handle function called when the user change the input field.

	```javascript
		cosnt handleChange = function( string ){ /* String in the input field */ }
	```
* handleSelect (Function): **Required** When the user click over a suggest this function is called with the value of the suggestion.

	```javascript
		const handleSelect = function( value ){ /* selectionÂ´s value */ }
	```

and then you have to create containers which one setting that properties in the sui-autocompleted component. You can view an example of this kind of container in the [doc folder](https://github.com/scm-spain/sui-autocompleted/blob/master/docs/autocompleted-container.jsx).

### SuggestObject

An SuggestObject is a plain JS Object with three specials keys:

```javascript
{
    'id': [Unique id for the suggestion],
    'value': [value to be passed at the handleSelect callback]
    'content': [React Component] or [Text to be show in the UI]
}
